##Working Title: 		Tinder Image Classifier

###Collection Used:		
BL Flickr Images

###Collection Size:		
1 million images, 50gb?

###Interaction	
  Joystick left or right to quickly classify images based on a question / criteria defined by us (see metadata collected). The question could be fixed, or could be randomized. This mimics the ‘Tinder’ app for online matchmaking. Left = yes, Right = no. Could have 4 motions (up, down, left, right) because of the nature of the joystick. Very short interaction with each image. Could be as fast as 1 per second. Potential for high through-put. Perhaps a countdown timer to keep them moving quickly.

	Images should be shown to scale.

	Users could gain points for each image classified, which could be used to unlock other levels / mini-games / rewards. Ideally, the metadata collected is intelligently incorporated in to the game for future players. So the subsets created with ‘face / no face’, once they reach a critical mass, trigger a new game: ‘glasses / no glasses’ or ‘beard / no beard’. Maybe these new games are ‘unlocked’ and users are challenged to help us reach goals that then allow those future classifications. Almost like we’re all playing together.

	Button 1 could be used to request that the image on the screen be emailed to you (then you submit your email address).

	Button 2 could let the user stop on a particular image and fill in the full set of metadata.


###Metadata Collected:

Possible a/b/c/d questions
•	Primarily animal/vegetable/mineral/other
•	In focus / bit blurry
•	I know what this is / no idea what this is
•	Face / no face
o	Glasses /no glasses
o	Beard / no beard
o	Male / female
o	Old / young /adult
o	Etc etc…


###Validation	

Validated by seeking classification agreement across multiple users. As far as I know, none of these details are known in the metadata.


###Why this is useful	
It’s a very quick game and easy enough to build, I think. The iterative improvements to the metadata could result in quite a few new classifications in the Flickr collection.

###Why this is fun	
Fairly mindless. Quickness of the interaction is the real appeal. The unlocking new levels may be appealing.

##Working Title: 		Image Gradients

###Collection Used:		
BL Flickr Images

###Collection Size:		
1 million images, 50gb?


###Interaction	
  Users are given an endless stream of images, and asked to classify them by their level of photo-realism. They align the image with its corresponding equivalent shown at the bottom of the screen. This is done via the joystick and then a button-press.

	As above, these classifications could be reincorporated into the game for building future subsets that are used in other parts of the game. A game that learns effectively.

	Since art styles change dramatically over time, it would be worth limiting the images shown to a particular user in a particular session by the date of publication of the book from which the image came. That won’t work perfectly, but it should make it a bit more similar.


###Metadata Collected:	
For each image, we get a sense of the level of detail in the image itself. How closely it resembles a photograph.
 

###Validation	
Validated by seeking classification agreement across multiple users. As far as I know, none of these details are known in the metadata.


###Why this is useful	
This has advantages because it makes it possible to show users comparable images in other games, instead of putting a scribble next to a photo.

###Why this is fun	
Good question. Would probably have to limit this to a few interactions and then get someone to move on to something else. Maybe do 5 and then be taken to a more fun game.

###Working Title		
Image Age Trivia

###Collection Used:	
BL Flickr Images

###Collection Size:		
1 million images, 50gb?

###Interaction	
Users are shown 3 images randomly drawn from the collection (perhaps those classified above by level of photorealism) and are asked to guess which one is the oldest / newest.

###Metadata Collected:	
Data on how well the users are able to judge the relative age of an image.

###Validation	
Validated with metadata about the publication date of the book. This will fail in some instances where the image is a reproduction of a much earlier work.


###Why this is useful	
People like to test themselves, so this could be a breather game in between more serious collection.

###Why this is fun	
People like to test themselves. This will appeal to some people more than others. Someone with no idea of any of the answers will find this unrewarding.

###Working Title		Crime Robot

###Collection Used:		
Old Bailey Online criminal trial transcripts

###Collection Size:		
127 million words of text

###Interaction	
Users are shown 1 paragraph of text, and using a little avatar they are asked to move their dude over specific types of information in the paragraph and effectively tag it by clicking on the button.


###Metadata Collected:	
Range of possibilities:
-	time of crime (could be a clock-like interface)
-	items stolen
-	value of items stolen.
				


###Validation	
It’s possible to extract a lot of this stuff semi-automatically, but the human would be validating that semi-automatic work, and might also find additional details missed by the other process.


###Why this is useful	
Fits with my research needs to structure this data, and also tests a way to work with textual crowdsourcing that doesn’t involve a keyboard.

###Why this is fun	
Not sure it is. Non-keyboard text-based crowdsourcing.
